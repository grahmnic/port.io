Going to be redoing my portfolio. Trello: https://trello.com/b/t9kwuwyX/portfolio2020

## Port.io

I liked the minimalistic/retro style of the original portfolio.<br />
I hated the user experience and I found myself prioritizing the cool factor over accessibility.<br />
Here are some of the features, either planned or already implemented.

### Setup Wizard

**Time is money.** Skip the cool stuff and get straight into who I am as a person and as a developer.<br />

### Desktop Base

**It's not like I copied things over from my old portfolio.** Comes with a taskbar to rewind time, start-up window cause why the hell not, programs/malware that you've installed, and a kickass background that I may or may not have pulled from Google Images and edited in Gimp in 5 minutes.

### Annoying Mascot

**Should've went straight to the potato version.** Just uninstall it.

### Installing Port.io

**This is what you came for.** You can see boring me portrayed in a creative light.

If you aren’t satisfied with my portfolio, you can `eject` at any time by clicking the `x` at the right of the tab. 

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
